Sharing my Python project report on the Canteen Management System, developed as part of my coursework at MPSTME.

The system modernizes institutional canteen operations by digitizing ordering, billing, payments and reporting. Built using Python, Tkinter, SQLite, Matplotlib and ReportLab, it supports role-based access for Students, Attendants and Managers. Users can place orders, make UPI-QR payments, download receipts, track status in real time, and view analytics on sales and demand patterns 

Core highlights:
✔ Role-based dashboards
✔ QR-based digital payment flow
✔ Auto-generated PDF receipts
✔ Offers and discount logic
✔ Real-time order tracking
✔ Analytics for daily sales, top items and revenue trends 

This system streamlines queues, reduces manual errors and improves transparency in canteen environments. Posting the full report for academic reference and future enhancement work.
